NAME
----
zypp-CheckAccessDeleted - List processes which access deleted files


SYNOPSIS
--------
*zypp-CheckAccessDeleted* [_OPTION_]...


DESCRIPTION
-----------
List running processes which access deleted files. This may help to identify services and processes which need to be restarted after an update, e.g. if they still refer to meanwhile deleted libraries. The output is similar to `*zypper ps*' but does not sort out processes accessing normal files only.


OPTIONS
-------
*--help*::
	display help and exit
